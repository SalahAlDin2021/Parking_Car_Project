# Parking_Car_Project
This is project for Mobile Devolopment course COMP438

Our app makes it easy for car drivers to find parking in busy cities and crowded areas. 
Simply open the app will then search for nearby parking options, including street parking, garages, and lots,
and display a list of options to you. You can see  the cost of parking, and any time restrictions that may be in place. 
Simply choose your preferred option and  go to the parking lot.
